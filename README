Description:

A javascript command line I built for the 2010 js1k competition. Description submitted with my entry:

Canvas based JavaScript command line 
Completely canvas rendered (no input/textarea elements or overlays) active command line which lets you build JS scripts on the fly. 

Features: 
-- Built in memory; stores assigned variables for you to be used later 
-- Colorful error message with details on what went wrong 
-- Namespaced to prevent (most) collisions with code you write and the running script 
-- HIDDEN EASTER EGG: Have fun with it :) 

How to use: 
	Set variables: 
		variable_name = function/value/object (don't use var in front of name) 
	Use variables: 
		Call the variable name directly (i.e. x*y) 
	Use function: 
		variable_name(arguments) Backspace key deletes, Enter executes line, functional shift for uppercase/alt-punctuation, arrows keys are symbol shortcuts (I claim feature :D)

-- Entering 'c0w' (- quotes) on the command line randomly changes the color of the input prompt and entered text
-- The js1kTester page is a simulation of the actual frame the scripts were expected to run in
