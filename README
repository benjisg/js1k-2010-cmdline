Description:
	A javascript command line built for the 2010 js1k competition. Completely canvas rendered (no input/textarea elements or overlays) active command line which lets you build JS scripts on the fly.

Features: 
	-- Built in memory; stores assigned variables for you to be used later 
	-- Error handling and and prompting
	-- Namespaced to prevent (most) collisions with evaluated code
	
How to use: 
	Set variables: 
		variable_name = function/value/object (don't use var in front of name) 
		
	Use variables: 
		Call the variable name directly (i.e. x*y) 
		
	Use function: 
		variable_name(arguments) Backspace key deletes, Enter executes line, functional shift for uppercase/alt-punctuation, arrows keys are symbol shortcuts
